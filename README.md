### Hello there!

I'm Pi Esposito, AI Engineer [@printbear](https://github.com/printbear) and Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning.


## About me

I live in the country-side somewhere in the world, have an awesome family: an awesome wife and two awesome dogs. I'm a nerd. I also work remotely.



## I built this thing that I'm very proud of:

[BLiTZ](https://github.com/piEsposito/blitz-bayesian-deep-learning/) - A Bayesian Deep Learning lib on the top of PyTorch
