### Hello there!

I'm Pi Esposito, Machine Learning Engineer [@printbear](https://github.com/printbear) and Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning.


## About me

I live in the country-side somewhere in the world, have an awesome family and two awesome dogs. I'm a nerd. I also work remotely.



## I built this thing that I'm very proud of:
