## Hello there!

I'm Pi Esposito, ai computer nerd.

## About me

I am a Member of Technical Staff, Research at [Runway](https://runwayml.com), where I've worked on [Gen-3](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-gen-3-alpha), [Frames](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-frames) and more.

I built [BLiTZ](https://github.com/piEsposito/blitz-bayesian-deep-learning/), Bayesian Deep Learning lib on the top of PyTorch. I also [trained a nice finetune of Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/22h/vintedois-diffusion-v0-1).
